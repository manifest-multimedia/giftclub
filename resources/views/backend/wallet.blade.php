<p>The total security infrastructure of any online system is on two fronts: system security and user security. 
    This website has spared no expenses to provide the best security for our systems in order to ensure that our assets and investments 
    always remain secure. We have carefully selected partners who share our beliefs and need for security; our payment gateway and 
    digital asset custodial solutions partners boast some of the highest security standards in the industry.</p>
<p> However, all these security investment falls short if our members fail to adhere to a few security protocols to protect their
     accounts. As cryptocurrencies and digital assets continue to gain worldwide acceptance and growth as an industry, the need to 
     remain ever vigilant and employ the best practices to protect your assets continue to increase. We recommend that our members 
     follow the simple but effective rules of thumb below to keep their accounts and investment safe.</p>
